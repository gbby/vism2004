% Course Description
\newcommand{\CourseDesc}{
This course offers students critical, theoretical, and analytical tools to understand contemporary internet issues through study of the history, research methodologies and emerging debates and practices relevant to the World Wide Web. The course will examine web technologies, web aesthetics, the transformation of information in the web, web regulation and copyright, political economy of the internet, web entertainment, and the construction of web identities. Students will develop theoretical and practical tools to help them navigate a number of messy questions that rise to the surface when we begin peeling the multiple layers that constitute the assemblage we've come to understand as today's internet.

%Ashley's:
%Nearly three decades have passed since media scholar Friedrich Kittler famously claimed that “media determine our situation.” Living in the 21 st century, his edict sounds almost clichéd – our contemporary lives are so thoroughly mediated, so fundamentally entwined with an array of gadgets, apps and entertainment platforms, that it would be impossible to deny the role of media in shaping how we understand the world around us. Despite this, we don’t always question how media frame reality; how they impact us as individuals; how they shape socio-cultural relations; or how they inform our politics. In this introductory course, we will tease apart our experiences of contemporary media in an effort to begin engaging critically with the media in our midst. We won’t work from the sort of introductory textbook that tells you “what” the media “is,” since you’ve all grown up in mediated environments. Instead, we will be starting from your experiences of the media – not so much your passive, 20 th century experiences of “broadcast” media (watching TV, listening to the radio, or reading books and magazines), but instead your interactive, 21 st century experiences of “social” media (blogging, gaming, chatting, and so on). We will bring in academic commentary in order to clarify those experiences and to help you ask more provocative questions about them. In other words, we will move from practice to theory rather than the other way around.

}

% Learning Outcomes
\newcommand{\LearnOut}{
In addition to providing students with a grounding in the emerging field of Internet Studies, this course introduces students to an interdisciplinary range of methods of analysis and critique. Students will develop familiarity and facility with a range of terms, theories, technologies, and approaches related to analysis and critique of internet structures and usages. As well, students will apply critical tools to their own interactions with the web through internet-based writing and analysis assignments.

% This course is designed to give students an overview of internet web theory, research, history and design fundamentals, including basic understanding of coding and software commonly used to build web sites. At the end of the semester, students should have a broad understanding of issues related to the internet and web development, and basic practical understanding of skills useful in building web sites. Note: this is not a course for students who wish to learn web design skills, but for students who wish to understand the web as a social and cultural medium. 
}

% Course Organization
% Update all dates
\newcommand{\CourseOrg}{
The major part of the course consists of weekly classes comprised of a lecture, discussion, and a different hands-on exercise each week. Students are expected to read the required readings, attend all classes, participate in all activities and contribute to discussion! Plan to accommodate a minimum of 4 hours per week of homework for this course. Absences from class must be supported with official documentation; three unsupported absences may jeopardize your standing in the course.

% each week, we will engage in some kind of hands-on exercise, making, unmaking, implosion, explosion, etc. dowse, media archaeology

% Course Assignments and Evaluation

\textbf{Web Portfolio Assignments:} \\
%students will write entries about case studies or made/found objects each week
%%we will use mozilla webmaker, jsfiddle, kodeweave, plotly, and a handful of other tools. 
%%samples will be available on my github
Students will make entries in their Web Journal every week. After each class, you will choose a website and examine it using one of the analytical tools presented in the preceding class. Each weekly Web Journal entry should be at least 250 words (1 double spaced typewritten page). Your Web Journal will be submitted for evaluation on two different due dates: February 10 and March 31. You will be evaluated on the relevance of the websites that you choose to analyze and on the effective use of analytical tools presented in class to examine your chosen website.\newline
\textbf{Examinations:} \\ 
A primary method of evaluation and assigning grades will be through a mid-term exam on February 10, from 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm in Room 7320, and a final exam, date time and location to be confirmed. Exams will consist of multiple choice, fill in the blank and essay questions.

Please first check your registration and read the codes carefully (the codes are clearly explained in the Course Calendar which is available on-line at www.ocadu.ca).

Students with special needs must contact the Centre for Students with Disabilities, ext. 339 at least two weeks prior to the test or assignment.
}

% Absences for Religious Reasons
\newcommand{\Religious}{
A student who foresees a conflict between a religious obligation and any scheduled class assignments, including the final examination, must notify his/her instructor in writing and in the case of final examinations must make a written request to the Office of the Registrar within three weeks of publishing of the syllabus and/or the final exam schedule. 
}

% Plagiarism
\newcommand{\Plagiarism}{
Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else's ideas, opinions, writings, etc. and representing them as one's own. You plagiarize whenever you borrow another scholar's ideas or quote directly from a work without giving credit through proper citation or acknowledgement. Plagiarism is a serious offense at OCADU (please see OCADU's Policy in the OCADU Academic Calendar). Any assignment in which the ideas of another author are intentionally represented without acknowledgement and/or presented as the student's own work will receive a grade of zero. Please see the following web link for more information:
\url{http://www.ocadu.ca/students/academic_integrity.htm}
} 

% Academic Honesty
\newcommand{\AcaHon}{
Each student has final responsibility for their conduct. Students are expected to be aware of and abide by the regulations as they have been established in OCAD U’s academic and non-academic policies, which can be found on the OCAD U website at the following web link under “Student Policies”: \url{http://www.ocadu.ca/students/student-policies.htm}. These policies outline the responsibility of students to “conduct themselves appropriately and reflect the highest standards of integrity in non-academic as well as academic behaviour”. All allegations of misconduct will be reported and investigated as per the current policies.
