# syllabus

This is a LaTeX template for a syllabus. I modified it from [this template by Steven Clontz.](https://github.com/StevenClontz/syllabus/archive/master.zip).

## How to Use

Download the files and open up syllabus.tex in your favorite TeX editor. (I switch between TeXstudio and AUCTeX on Emacs.) Change all the variables to fit your course, and then compile to PDF.

#### Comfortable with Git?

* Clone the repo as your `master` branch
* `git checkout semester-specific-branch-name` to make a new branch for
  the semester
* Update `syllabus.tex` to fit your course, then build your PDF.
