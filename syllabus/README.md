# Syllabus

This is a LaTeX version of the course syllabus (with an associated .pdf). I modified it from [this template by Steven Clontz.](https://github.com/StevenClontz/syllabus/archive/master.zip). To use, simply download the files and open up syllabus.tex in your favorite TeX editor. (I switch between AUCTeX on Emacs and TeXstudio, depending on the mood I'm in.)
