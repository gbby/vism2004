    <h1>VISM2004 Week 10 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>For this week's journal assignment, you will need to think about your own personal use of the internet. If you weren't in class on Monday, I've posted a number of links on Canvas that might help you, but you'll also want to spend some time looking through your browser history, searching for digital breadcrumbs you might have left over time, and imagining what kinds of pictures could be painted by this information. Please write a journal entry that addresses <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do a verbatim search for your name using Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and any other search engines or tools you can think of. From the first page, are there any links that a Kafkaesque bureaucrat (or nefarious stalker) could follow to piece together a substantial profile of you? How many hops would it take to figure out your age? Where you went to school? Who you are friends with? Who your family members are? Whether you are in a relationship? Where you work? Your home address? Whether you engage in illegal or "immoral" activities and post incriminating evidence online? In other words, could a potential future employer disqualify you from a position with 10 minutes of sleuthing? Maybe imagine a scenario in which a potential suitor or devious social engineer could discover enough about you to seed a conversation, or an authority figure could use this information for the purpose of entrapment... how does this make you feel about your own privacy?</li>
        <li>What do you have to hide? Given the discussion of Daniel Solove's supplementary reading about the fallacy of "nothing to hide" argument that we had in class, think about whether you have anything you might be hiding. Do you have any potential skeletons in your closet? Should you be able to keep your terrorist sympathies or pedophilic tendencies buried in your inbox? Are you a furry who secretly dreams of running for President one day? Have you ever retweeted a racist, sexist, or homophobic joke that you now regret? Should you have the right to retract comments or make amends? For those who do actually have things to "hide," should their right to privacy be diminished?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As always, be creative. You've seen your journal feedback... the best answers are personal ones.</p>
