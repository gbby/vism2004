    <h1>VISM2004 Week 9 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>For this week's journal assignment, you will need to draw on our discussion of the infrastructure that undergirds the internet. If you weren't in class yesterday, there are a number of links posted on Canvas that might help you make sense of this exercise. Here's what you are asked to do: write a journal entry that considers <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are an "invisible worker" somewhere in the vast infrastructure of the internet. Describe a day in your life. Is it boring? Does it resemble <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtUpmfdtwGo">Office Space</a>? What sort of people or things do you encounter?</li>
        <li>What kind of materials make up the infrastructure of the internet? If you're inclined toward designing interactive visuals, you might model your response on this really interesting <a href="http://robertmcmahon.ca/#/interactive-wall/">interactive wall</a> exhibit in the Teck Geology Galleries at the ROM that highlights materials in objects like smartphones and skateboards. Otherwise, you should describe a few different materials that the internet is "made of" (so to speak), taking into account where they come from (e.g. are they mined?), whether they are robust or fragile, and what can they tell us about the permanence of the infrastructural element that you are highlighting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As always, be creative! Don't write a wikipedia paragraph... use your imagination!</p>
