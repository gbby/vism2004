    <h1>VISM2004 Week 4 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>Continuing your journal, this week you are asked to address
    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of
    the following two prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write or modify an example .html page and fill it with comments - look above!! - that describe what's going on in the HTML markup. Your goal will be to explain how a simple .html page works to someone who is completely unfamiliar with it. You might comment on the functionality of specific items, or you might pay attention to standards that determine how the code is rendered and comment on values embedded in the code;</li>
        <li>Write a short, interactive, creative narrative in <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> linking two authors or ideas we've covered in the first couple of weeks (e.g. Innis/McLuhan; time-based media/space-based media; Shannon/Turing). You might get slightly meta and analyze features that differentiate interactive digital text platforms like Twine from similar non-digital writing methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Read the announcements I post in Canvas and you might find a few easter eggs that could help you...</p>
