    <h1>VISM2004 Week 5 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>Continuing your journal, spend a bit of time exploring these two websites: <a href="http://selfiecity.net/">http://selfiecity.net/</a> and <a href="http://networkeffect.io/">http://networkeffect.io/</a></br>    
    
    Discuss how the selection of a self-portrait or avatar acts as a crucial facet of online identity production. Consider this with regard to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of
    the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>contemporary issues related to personal branding and the culture of social media celebrity</li>
        <li>or the notion that "the internet never forgets"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As usual, there is no <i>right</i> way to answer this. Be thoughtful, creative, and even personal. Keep an eye on Canvas announcements for information about how you might submit your first batch of journal assignments (which are due the first class back after reading week).</p>
