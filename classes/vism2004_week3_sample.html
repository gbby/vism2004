    <h1>VISM2004 Week 3 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>Continuing your journal, this week you are asked to address
    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of
    the following two prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give a short analysis of how Innis's "biases of communication" or McLuhan's "medium is the message" might apply to some form of contemporary new media (e.g. big data visualization, 3D printing, virtual reality gaming);</li>
        <li>Or, create a slideshow of up to 5 probes and embed them in your journal entry. You don't need to write any additional text beyond what you'll include in the probe images, and you can place them in whatever format you like (.gif; JavaScript slideshow; embedded video player). If you wish to add comments describing or explaining your probes, feel free to do so, but don't consider it a necessary part of this exercise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be creative!!</p>
