  <h1>Welcome to somebody's VISM2004 journal!!</h1>

  <p>Using <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Thimble</a> or an appropriate alternative (e.g. <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>; raw html), students will create a "home page" for their journal, as well as a "week 1 page" on which they will share thoughts (in around 200-250 words) on: 
    <ul>
      <li>where the internet came from (using the Abbate article or the CBC video for reference);</li>
      <li>where the internet is going (using the Motherboard or Wired pieces for reference);</li>
      <li>what "the internet" means to them.</li>
    </ul> 
  </p>
