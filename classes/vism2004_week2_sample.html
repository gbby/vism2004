    <h1>VISM2004 Week 2 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>Continuing your journal, this week you are asked to respond to
    <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of
    the following two prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Imagine that you are a researcher at SRI in the early 1970s. You
        have classified information that needs to be shared with a research
        team at MIT. Taking into account the differences between centralized
        and distributed (packet-switched) network topologies, write a brief
        <em>speculative</em> scenario describing how your message might cross
        the country. Be creative in imagining variables that could influence
        your narrative, and feel free to include images.<br>
            This short piece from the Week 1 supplementary readings might be
            helpful: <a href=

            If you would like to use images in your .html and don't know how,
            consult this page: <a href=

        </li>
        <li>Abbate writes: "The qualities valued by the original, nonprofit
        ARPANET community remain embedded in today's commercial Internet: in
        particular, the emphasis on flexibility and openness in the research
        community led to a more open, adaptable, and universally usable system.
        Building on this technical foundation, the business sector helped to
        broaden access to network products and services, provide user-friendly
        interfaces, and offer content that would appeal to the general
        public."<br>
        Given our discussion about the original "purpose" of the internet,
        ruminate on how these embedded values might influence your
        <em>personal</em> browsing experience. A few considerations that might
        guide your writing: do you favour open sharing, content consumption, or
        both? Do you think the internet is a public good, like water, requiring
        public development and management, or is it something best left to the
        corporate sector to develop, package, and sell? These do not have to be
        mutually exclusive claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, this is not an "intro to web coding" exercise, so do not
    stress if you can't figure out how to write this in .html. For now, just do
    your best.</p>
