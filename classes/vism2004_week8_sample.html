    <h1>VISM2004 Week 8 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>For this week's journal assignment, you will need to familiarize yourself with the concepts of <em>remixing</em> and <em>remix</em> culture. If you weren't in class yesterday, a simple Wikipedia search should get you started (but you might also want to check out some of the links that will be posted on Canvas). With a general understanding of these concepts, you are asked to creatively remix some object that you find on the internet. It can be an image, a piece of music, a chunk of text... and you can remix it however you like! In the process, though, you are also asked to write a journal entry that considers <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Given this snippet from the article on Richard Prince that we read this week - <em>"The case of Cariou v. Prince became highly contentious: while people in the contemporary art world favored Prince’s stance, photographers endorsed Cariou. Ultimately, in 2013, the Second Circuit made its ruling: Prince’s appropriation was 'transformative' enough to qualify for fair use. In the words of the presiding judge: '[Prince’s] work adds new meaning...and the fair use doctrine guarantees [him] breathing space.'"</em> - how "transformative" should your remixed work be in order to be legal (or even ethical)? Are you engaging in theft, appropriation, or piracy? Is that alright with you?</li>
        <li>If you have to pay for the right to use the base work you've modified, how much should you be expected to pay, and to whom? Would you ask for permission first, or, like Prince, wait to "deal with it later" if you got sued?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As usual, I'm looking for your genuine thoughts. Be creative! And please make sure to include your remixed object with your journal.</p>
