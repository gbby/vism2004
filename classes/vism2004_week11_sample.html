    <h1>VISM2004 Week 11 Journal!!</h1>
    <p>For this week's journal assignment (your final one!), you will again need to think about your own personal use of the internet. As with the last assignment, I've posted a number of links on Canvas that might help you if you weren't in class on Monday. Please write a journal entry that addresses <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span></strong> of the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look through your browser history (CTRL-H on Firefox and Chrome, Option+âŒ˜+2 on Safari) and spend some time looking at what you click. Where does your browsing originate at the start of the day? Do you have a homepage (google.com, for example) that you start from? How much time do you spend in gmail or facebook? Does your browsing follow a continuous path or narrative flow, or is it all over the place? There are browser apps (timeStats on chrome) that you can install to help you visualize this information if you're interested in knowing how much time you spend on particular sites, for example. Once you have a fairly decent sense of where your attention goes online, comment on how this knowledge makes you feel. Are you ashamed about clicking 50+ youtube links over the span of 3 hours? Excited about the fact that you finished an entire khan academy module? Would you be comfortable sharing your web use data with a) your parents b) your boss c) your potential romantic partner(s) or d) your friends?</li>
        <li>Alternatively, read the previous prompt... don't answer it, but respond to it with regard to your facebook use. How much time do you spend on FB? Do you click on links in your news feed? Do you let it take you outside of facebook, or is your feed a de facto home base? If you find yourself aimlessly scrolling facebook frequently, what motivates this behaviour? Boredom? Are you in control? How would you take more control of your feed if you could? As with the previous answer, think about whether you would be comfortable sharing your news feed data (and clicking behaviour) with the groups listed above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've enjoyed reading all the journals so far, so I especially look forward to reading these final responses!</p>
