          <h1>Rematerializing Collapse</h1>
          <h3>Materialities of the Digital: Infrastructure</br>4S 2015</h3></br>
          <h4>Gabby Resch</br>Critical Making Lab</br>University of Toronto</h4>

          <aside class="notes">
            So, a quick bio... I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and long-time member of the Critical Making Lab in the Faculty of Information, where I work with Matt Ratto. My research exists where STS, HCI, and Museology intersect; specifically, my dissertation research examines epistemic commitments and disjunctures that emerge in the design of computationally-enhanced multisensory interaction, especially as they are articulated through messy dichotomous framings that presuppose either dialectic or binary opposite relationships; think: material/digital, ocularcentric/multisensory, disembodied/embodied, lexico-discursive/phenomenological, head/hands, real/simulated, authentic/reproduced, or ephemeral/resonant. In my research, I ask whether these dichotomies might be better thought of, through a diffractive reading (following Karen Barad (2007)), as being entangled.

            So, while a good deal of what I study has to do with problems related to ocularcentric interaction and challenges associated with extending the museum sensorium through interactive multisensory experiences, more practically my work involves bringing together material and digital resources, frequently as a way to illuminate critical and topical themes.

            Can reconciling epistemic disjunctures and negotiating entanglements inherent in the emerging field of computationally-enhanced multisensory interaction foster innovative methods for engaging visitors with what Maria Puig de la Bellacasa (2011) refers to as 'matters of care' and to getting publics to both care for things (cultural heritage objects), and about things (emerging sociotechnical challenges, the sustainability of institutions)?

          <blockquote>
            We see how an animal, plant, mineral, or artifact can sometimes catalyze a public, and we might then see how to devise more effective (experimental) tactics for enhancing or weakening that public.</br> - Jane Bennett
          </blockquote>

          <aside class="notes">
            This is early work. I'm not reporting findings (yet), as this is merely a sub-project of my broader doctoral study, but it's a project that I'm hoping to turn into something larger. What rematerializing collapse seeks is an intervention into what Eugene Thacker (2011) calls an increasingly "unthinkable" world - a rethinking that resists binary utopian/dystopian terms.

            Inspired by recent HCI work calling for research into the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity by Tomlinson et al. (Tomlinson, 2013collapse), as well as arguments for broadening museum interaction to emphasize phenomenological touch over ocularcentrism by Elee Wood and Kiersten Latham (Wood, 2011), among others,

            This work uses museum artifacts from historical collapse periods as evocative resources in speculative design and critical making experiences. These experiences draw on Jane Bennett's reading of Dewey and Rancière to consider how artifacts from the material record might "catalyze a public" and enable us to "entertain a set of crazy and not-so-crazy questions" (Bennett, 2009), such as how we might begin to think through potential future decline, loss of complexity, or full-scale collapse. I'm taking a very literal reading of the term artifact which derives its etymological root from the latin ars (meaning `by skill') and factum (meaning `thing made'), pointing to an artifact constituting ``something that is made by the skill of humans.'' The word object, which is often used interchangeably with artifact in cultural heritage contexts, has a more curious origin. It derives from the latin objectum, roughly translating to "thrown against" which, in the specific context of museum materiality, carries an essentialist meaning - in other words, ``something that has a physical and material existence.'' Something you can throw against a wall. The work I'm discussing today seeks to denaturalize and unsettle current systems by envisioning scenarios for when some of them might fail, and is aligned with a larger effort by sustainable HCI researchers and STS scholars who are attempting to make the abstract future of collapse more tangible and immediate.

            <aside class="notes">
              But what does it mean to think the unthinkable future? Surely, before intervening in some meaningful way, we need to have this sorted out, right? There are certainly different states of collapse that might warrant greater attention, including loss of complexity, infrastructure degradation, and forced migration. Might we include a technocratic future as a kind of coming collapse - one in which the values and politics that many of us aspire toward are negated by rational systems? I cannot affod a deep consideration of the various conditions of collapse here, but there is certainly an abundance of exciting work on the subject, especially around the emerging area of anthropocene studies. We can read Tainter's classic 1988 text, or a number of valuable recent works - Conway and Oreskes' (2013) book, for example. How have others thought the unthinkable? Some, in fields like design, might promote speculative futures, both utopian and dystopian. Others suggest we recognize that collapse is already underway, albeit in an uneven distribution, and that we should embrace the emancipatory possibilities of radical transformation that it might bring. In HCI, we encounter scholars advocating persuasive technologies. There are kits on how to rebuild civilization (Gingery Books, for example, publishes an entire set), and a new climate museum is set to open up in New York in the coming years, with a dedicated focus on illuminating some of these topics.

              How about designing multisensory interaction to bridge the material artifact world to the digital? Considering that one of the first and, to this date, only museum exhibits dedicated to the subject was billed as using creative multisensory engagement, I believe this to be a promising area of critical intervention, especially through the deliberate deployment of negative affect as an engagement strategy. What is the phenomenology of doom, as I've heard it referred to recently, and how can it be brought into service as a design approach, especially given the reluctance of many museums toward it?

              While I'm optimistic that creative applications might promote empathy with those who have lived the unthkinkable, I'm dubious of doing this through historical reenactment. There are already places where people can do historical reenactment, but what i'm proposing is not reeneactment - I don't use material-digital making to reverse engineer the past, or even to "remake" it necessarily. Archaeologist Yannis Hamilakis (2012) cautions against attempts to replicate sensorial experiences by electron­ic, mechanical, and biochemical means, asking how we can claim to mimic, through a static, isolat­ed	body, the	sensorial	experience of	another	time and another place without the affective and mnemonic	weight that	a lived	experience	of such	a	place	and	time generates on	moving,	mingled	bodies.

              Instead, I wonder whether the design of an artifact might reveal something about the conditions of response that could illuminate our current responses. Or, are there object biographies that reveal as much about contemporary relations as they do about historical ones. What Are Evocative Collapse Objects? Consider this eschatological artifact from the Louvre, which depicts the Atrahasis story, which is the eariest known story of the end of the world, about a man who builds an ark to survive a great flood which is blamed on humans making so much noise with their tools that they angered the gods. What might creative visitors produce with a digital scan of this object?

              Consider the Maine penny, also known as the Goddard coin, which is displayed at the Maine State Museum. This particular example purports to demonstrate evidence of extensive trading networks between Vikings and natives, despite evidence that the Vinland Norse collapse occurred in part because of a refusal to trade and adopt local hunting and eating customs. Ted Carpenter wrote a damning contemplation on claims of authenticity around Viking artifacts from the collapsed Vinland colony (and their relation to a trove of inauthentic artifacts in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum that brought shame on the museum's founder curator).

              Consider, as well, conflicting claims evidenced by this bundle of cordage in this image, which was found among a trove of Norse artifacts on Baffin Island that included notched sticks indicating some record of trade with locals, as well as rat pellets carried from the old world, more evidence of the vibrant materiality laying dormant in troves of artifacts. How might we breathe new life into a selection of these pieces by imagining what tools we'd leave behind... what traces of trade and migration will be inscribed into the earth, buried deep in our middens?

              Also, Patricia Sutherland, adjunct professor of archaeology at Memorial University in Newfoundland and a research fellow at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, has found evidence of a Viking camp on Baffin Island (Feder 2006, Pringle 2012). Things such as spun yarn, whetstones, metals, a whalebone shovel, and even the pellets of Old World rat stowaways from the ships (Pringle 2012). Sutherland’s dates are still being assessed, but the artifacts can be traced to as early as the 11th century (Feder 2006).
              from http://archyfantasies.com/tag/norse-in-america/
              On Baffin Island, archaeologists discovered cordage made the Viking way, as well as other evidence of European contact.
              or Did Vikings use these notched sticks to record trade transactions? Patricia Sutherland thinks so.

          <aside class="notes">
            One of the questions this panel asks has to do with the quote-unquote 'materialities of the digital'? What are the materialities of the museum - of the quote-unquote "material record" - that can be brought into concert with political action (see braidotti on bergsonian)? Museum materiality is far from elusive... it is right there in plain view. A vital materialist consideration - following Rosi Braidotti, who has argued for a kind of contemporary Spinozism purified of any remaining essentialism, guided by a Bersonian temporality, and encompassing both living and not-quite-living entities - reveals the kind of latent power hidden in dark museum archives.

            What is "rematerialization" then? I generally employ "critical making," something we like to think of in our lab as a kind of materially productive engagement, not as a way to produce new goods or artifacts, but to arrange new agential formations - new publics. I don't promote a deterministic narrative of new technology - one that suggests they empower users, or somehow grant agency on them, as if agency is something technology developers or institutions like museums can simply grant.
            That said, the museum participatory trend that enables things like bioblitzes affords an opportunity to promote what tomlinson et al refer to as the sort of collectives of technofuturists...
            intergenerational museum visits enable wisdom of years transfer

            Why digital making and not just immersive environment
            Enables a different kind of interpretation
            why digital and not just material making? what about some of the museum exhibits and experiences that already address this issue? - narrative possibilities; possibility to reconfigure an object's meaning or understand/communicate different facets of its original use
            recognizing that objects are in an always ongoing state of reworking and power
            Here, I'm drawing on historian Bill Turkel's suggestion to look for spaces where information can be transduced.
            \parencite{turkel2011intervention}

            % - not reverse engineering artifacts to see how they worked, but doing it to see why they emerged as a response to collapse

            recognizing this entanglement of digital and material is recognizing a kind of relational materiality

            Next nature. What many fo these programs do is promote an entanglement of material and digital - technology and raw life.

            Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world.

            Another figure of power comes into play: that of a collective demand for signs of power - a holy union that is reconstructed around its disappearance. The whole world adheres to it more or less in terror of the collapse of the political. - baudrillard

          <aside class="notes">
            I take as a foundational question or starting point the following: What might we learn about the present - and this is important... it's not what can we learn about the past - when we imagine, design, and work to construct ideas for radical future transformations? By extension, what can we draw from our understanding of historical practices, trends, or episodes (both recent and long-passed) to illuminate this question? How have others lived the unthkinkable? What does the material record tell us? How did previous cultures respond to scarcity, for example, or overpopulation? Did they develop systems that we can draw inspiration from for our own future designs?

            A host of other questions guide my approach:
            Are there particular modes of thinking that might be encouraged in the sorts of interventions I propose? Empathy? Fear?
            How might making the museum more accessible contribute to making Information more accessible?
            Do cultural institutions have a responsibility to use the representational resources at their disposal to facilitate dialogue about topical issues that are not part of their core mandate?
            How does the landscape of cultural heritage become a site where information is transduced?
            How might both constructive and deconstructive "making" be deployed?
            Finally, where does this fit into larger programs to teach or encourage critical sociotechnical, digital, and information literacy?

            While this program asks that we ponder something that seems unimaginable, there is, of course, plenty of precedent for it... and museums hold the material record of this.

The first
is my relationship with the Laetoli diorama in the American Museum of Natural History. 5
In particular, I want to draw on two passages about the moment in time depicted in this
diorama. The first, from Diane Ackerman (1994, p. 335), noted artist and writer, asks of
the two prehistoric figures in the diorama:
What was their courtship like? What worries them? Do they imagine a future?
What delights their senses? How do they comfort their young? I long to meet
them face-to-face, to reach through time and touch them. It is like recognizing
one’s kin across the street in a bustling city.
A more interesting passage (to me, anyway) comes from Mary Leakey, the paleoanthropolo-
gist who unearthed the footprints upon which this diorama is inspired, in her description of
the smaller, likely female, tracks on the left (Leakey, 1979):
Incidentally, following her path produces, at least for me, a kind of poignant time
wrench. At one point, and you need not be an expert tracker to discern this, she
stops, pauses, turns to the left to glance at some possible threat or irregularity,
and then continues to the north. This motion, so intensely human, transcends
time. Three million six hundred thousand years ago, a remote ancestor - just as
you or I - experienced a moment of doubt.
